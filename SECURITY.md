# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The contents of this repo are provided as-is without any warranties, explicit or implied. As such there are no supported versions in the traditional sense.

While I request you use github features, incuding issues, as intended I make no promises they'll be addressed in a timely manner (if at all) or even be seen.

Ultimately responsibility for support lies with the user and they are free to modify as needed.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

I can't concieve of a vulnerability here that wouldn't exist with KiCad or another external entity.

Please report vulnerabilities to exteral parties first (e.g., https://github.com/KiCad), any repo specific notifications/issues should be filed using the issues feature.
