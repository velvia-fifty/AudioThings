# There's a security policy, for reasons

## Supported Versions

The contents of this repo are provided as-is without any warranties, explicit or implied. As such there are no supported versions in the traditional sense.

While I request you use github features, including issues, as intended I make no promises they'll be addressed in a timely manner (if at all) or even be seen.

Ultimately responsibility for support lies with the user and they are free to modify as needed.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

I can't conceive of a vulnerability here that wouldn't exist with KiCad or another external entity.

Please report vulnerabilities to external parties first (e.g., https://github.com/KiCad), any repo specific notifications/issues should be filed using the issues feature.

## Don't try this at home

If for some reason you came here hoping to find something about how to treat the burn you just gave yourself while assembling something, or because you burnt your house down:

- Silver burn cream
- Try it at a friend's house next time
