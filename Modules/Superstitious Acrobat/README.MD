# Superstitious Acrobat (and friends)

How many multiples give you the freedom to configure them how you want? OK but do they have *range*? I'm talking 1:13 to 14:0 range, how many 0 port multiples do you even have right now!?

## What problem are you trying to solve?

Consider the lede buried; I wanted a pair of FX loops and a compact way to shove a **FUCKTON** of signals into them. I also want the ability to touch those signals, not inappropriately but in the kind of way that garners stern looks of disapproval.

The first module is incredibly dense, your uncle's friend Dave from Facebook dense, A pair of 7 Stereo Jacks that you can slice, dice, and turn tricks with dense. Sure, you have to lay down solder blobs, and sure, you might have to think before you plug, but consider this:

Take a stereo signal, now give me two copies of that, and then a pair of each channel on the tip. Then take a second mono signal, split that six ways, and maybe throw the right channel of the other signal on the right side of half of those.

Why would you need to do that? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è, but now you can.

Wanna see me do some unorthodox splits?

Fill me up with a two pairs of stereo jacks (that's eight signals if you've lost count) and flip and twist until I make the sounds you like. Flip between each half of each pair, then blend each channel of those jacks.

Did this description need to be so passive aggressively sexual? üçÜüí¶‚òîÔ∏è

Oh right, the FX loops, did I mention that there's a flat-flex cable so you can route the multiple right to it, or whatever - the interface port is standardized... 'n junk.
