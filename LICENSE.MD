# Corporations are not people, they are not human, and they cannot have rights. They do not bleed, their brows do not glisten with sweat, and most importantly they can't be castrated as punishment for committing crimes against humanity.

## Opinions to the contrary are incorrect.

For the sake of argument, if I'm considering "I can cut their [redacted] off" as what bestows something rights: Presumably the people who work for the Corporation has a [redacted] or two among them to rub together.

### Your Licensing Model is Bad and You Should Feel Bad

The assertion that prohibiting non-commercial use is incompatible with "open source" is antithetical to human rights and you should feel bad for thinking otherwise.

The whole reason why we democratize a technology is to adjust the balance of power (as slight as it may be) and only a fool thinks that's done by distributing weight equally.

I'm using CC-BY-NC-SA for a reason, it's the closest thing to a "free as in guillotine" license there is. The fact of the matter is there's a difference between a person and a company and I'm only concerned about one of those two.

#### What Non-Commercial Means Here

From Creative Commons (emphasis added)

>CC’s NonCommercial (NC) licenses prohibit uses that are “primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or monetary compensation.” This is intended to capture the intention of the NC-using community without placing detailed restrictions that are either too broad or too narrow. Please note that CC’s definition does not turn on the type of user: if you are a nonprofit or charitable organization, your use of an NC-licensed work could still run afoul of the NC restriction, and if you are a for-profit entity, your use of an NC-licensed work does not necessarily mean you have violated the term. **Whether a use is commercial will depend on the specifics of the situation and the intentions of the user.**

I read this as allowing me to preserve my right to capitalism this thing and prevent you from doing a capitalism instead. If I wanted the fruits of my labor to make anyone money why would it be anyone but me.

Notice how you didn't pay for the fruits of my labor? I expect the favor to be repayed all the way down the line.

Want to make boards based on these designs? Go ahead, I can't stop you, but if you don't provide your end users with the opportunity opt to DIY instead of buy there's a problem.
