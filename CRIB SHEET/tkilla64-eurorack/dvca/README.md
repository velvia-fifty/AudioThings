This is a dual VCA based on a design from Music From Outer Space, made by Ray Wilson. It support both Lin and Log modes and it is DC-coupled, so it can be used for CV as well as Audio. I have adapted the design a bit by adding the CV Amount attenuator pot, the MUTE Mode and normalled the second channel to the first one. 

The original design is found here: http://musicfromouterspace.com/analogsynth_new/DUALVCA/DLLVCA001.html
