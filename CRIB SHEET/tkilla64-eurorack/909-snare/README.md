# 909-snare
![909SD image](909_SD.jpg)
This is the classic TR-909 snare drum based on the NeinOhNein Snare Drum from Hex Inverter. I have converted the design to SMT components that are easy to source.

The module needs the noise_board, which is connected as a piggy-back PCB on the back of the snare main PCB, using 2 x 4-pin header connectors.
