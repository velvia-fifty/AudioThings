# 909-cymbals
![909CY image](909CY.jpg)
This is the classic TR-909 cymbal voices. I have converted the design to SMT components that are easy to source.

There are three possible build option; 909CY with both voices and a switch (or control input jack) to select between them. The 909CS which is the Crash sound and 909RD which is the Ride sound.  
The 909CY needs a 64kByte EPROM to store both sounds. 909CS and 909RD uses 32kByte EPROMs. See notes in schematic diagram for details.

There are gerber files for three diffent PCB frontpanels; 909CY, 909CS or 909RD.
