## Navigating this hot mess

This repo is poorly organized and so am I, here are the main non-projet folders.
- [Art](./Art/)
    - Less-than-practical boards that are incomplete.
- [AT-Template](./AT-Template/)
    - KiCad template I've been using to make things.
- [CRIB SHEET](./CRIB%20SHEET/)
    - Things I ~stole~ used for inspiration.
- [Modules](./Modules/)
    - The stuff that's mostly complete
- [OLD](./OLD/)
    - The trashcan, I sometimes use this to store things


## I have opinions and they're loud

Opinions are for suckers, we have convictions (and they're obtuse).

### Maximize Cheap

If we wanted to spend money, we wouldn't pay with our time!

- Boards stay within 100mm x 100mm to get the cheapest per-board costs for small orders
- BOM includes actively produced parts unless there are no other options
- Rely on someone else's scale and use the most common solution in the wrong way

See: [Fab Min-Max Notes](./FAB_NOTES.MD)

### Form Factor Agnostic

- Assume Eurorack
- Assume Backplane
- Assume Stacking
- Assume Standalone

## Core Features

- Backplane preferred but optional
- Daughterboards are assumed (Minium PCB order is 5 after all)
