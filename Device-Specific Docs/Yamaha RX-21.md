# Yamaha RX-21

I found this sad drum machine at Guitar Center and bought it for like $25 no power supply or nothing. When I got it home I realized the power jack was bad, the screen was sad, and the buttons were... questionable.

Since I didn't need another project on my hands I went to return it and the manager said no problem but since they're just going to throw it away to just take it.

So now we're here.
