# Alesis SR-16

The SR-16 is a drum machine that attempts to (and mostly succeeds) provide real sounding drums without the need for all that drumming.

It's to the 90's what the TR-606 wanted to be in the 80's but since it sold well it's not all that expensive.

While the SR-16 is still for sale for about $150 it's been on the market since the beginning of time and can be found easily on secondary market. Not just online but flea markets, garage sales, thrift shops; there's probably one hiding in your closet somewhere. They reproduce asexually by budding.

### USB PD to 9VAC -or- Regulator hijack

More than 80% of all SR-16's found on the secondary market are "untested for parts" because the seller didn't have a 9VAC adapter. These adapters aren't uncommon, but it's the twenties so we can do better.
