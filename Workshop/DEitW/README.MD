# Densest Envelope in the West

You know what really chaps my ass? When I spend hours tweaking a knob and FINALLY It's just right, It never needs to be touched again because the demons in charge of such things will prevent me from getting it _just right_ ever again.

_**AND THEN THE KNOB HAS THE AUDACITY TO CONTINUE TO EXIST!? LIKE COME ON!!!**_

## What problem are you trying to solve?

I think I was pretty clear honestly...

Sometimes that **[redacted]** I just popped wasn't **[redacted]** and if I'm gonna be tweaking for the next 32 hours I don't want to lose all that progress. **SIX** ADSR Envelopes, **TWELVE** turns per pot; I can't math good but that's got to be at least a few hundred unique types of bloop per bleep.

Did I mention that the interface is offboard, cause the actual mailroom plops onto whatever board needs it most (or is handy); it even has the common decency to give you the option for internal trimpots, no panel space needed. _(Oh, and I stole the circuit from Ren√© Schmitz so it chooches)

But, I get it, you want to fondle those robot nips whenever you damn well please! It's a standard control interface my dude, if you don't care about density use big girl pots. I literally cannot stop you (but I can judge you)

The point is other modules can wear this as a hat, one of those fancy tiny bullshit hats that the royals wear to cockfights.
